## Description

The Stencil CLI is a command-line interface tool that helps you to initialize, develop, and maintain your Nest applications. It assists in multiple ways, including scaffolding the project, serving it in development mode, and building and bundling the application for production distribution. It embodies best-practice architectural patterns to encourage well-structured apps.

The CLI works with [schematics](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/tree/master/packages/angular_devkit/schematics), and provides built in support from the schematics collection at [@samagra-x/schematics](https://github.com/SamagraX-stencil/schematics).
